# TECHNOLOGIES

During the course of this project I have utilised the following technologies:


## Languages

- [**Python**](https://www.javascript.com/) was used to add interactivity and enrich the User eXperience


## Tools

- [**favicon**](https://www.favicon.cc/) was used to create a unique favicon for **nerdOmeter**

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control (commit to Git and push to GitHub)

- [**Gitpod**](https://www.gitpod.io/) was used to write my code; an online IDE linked to the GitHub repository

- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) was used to create the repository and store the project's code after being pushed from Git

- [**Chrome**](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) used to debug & test source code using HTML5 and to test site responsiveness

- [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com) used to generate project site maps and wireframes

- [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com) used for all fonts utilised in the project

- [**amiresponsive**](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) used to check how responsive the site is on different devices

- [**PEP8**](https://), [**Python Validator**](https://validator.w3.org/) used to validate all Python source code

## *Features to Implement*

- 

----


# VERSION CONTROL

Managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** via regular commits pushed to GitHub remote servers:


## Gitpod Workspaces
1. Starting from GitHub, clone the Code Institute template by clicking Use This Template and copying to my repo. Launch Workspace by clicking GitPod button - this action is only performed once and the workspace is subsequently reopened through GitPod.

2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an online IDE editor window.
    
    - Update GitHub by committing from GitPod

3. During editing save the code regularly, using git add ., git commit -m "commit message here" and git push Bash commands to push changes to the GitHub repository.

4. Meaningful commit messages allow easy roll-back of any changes to earlier versions.
